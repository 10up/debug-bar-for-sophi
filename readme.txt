Extends the Debug Bar plugin for the Sophi.io Site Automation service.

== Description ==

Extends the Debug Bar plugin for the [Sophi.io](https://www.sophi.io/) Site Automation service.  After installing and activating, click the `Debug` button in the admin toolbar.  Within the Debug Bar Panel, click the `Sophi` panel.

Note that the Debug Bar for Sophi plugin does not show the Sophi JavaScript Tracking activity in the Debug Bar as that's something that can be viewed with a browser console's `Network` tab.  Otherwise you should be able to view the Sophi Authentication request/response, Sophi API request/response, and CMS publish/update events in the Debug Bar to help triage your Sophi integration.

== Requirements ==

* PHP 7.4+
* WordPress 5.6+
* [Sophi](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sophi/) 1.1.0+
* [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) 1.0+ (note that this is already included on [WordPress VIP](https://wpvip.com/))

== Installation ==

1. Install the [Sophi](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sophi) plugin.
1. Install the [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) plugin.  Note that this is already included on [WordPress VIP](https://wpvip.com/).
